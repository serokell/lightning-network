# Lightning Network (`lightning-network`)

A Haskell interface for the Lightning Network.

Tools for working with payments on the Lightning Netowrk and interacting
with a Lightning Network node through its REST API.


## Use

### Overview

1. Use `Authorization.Macaroon.load` to read a macaroon from a file.
2. Import servant `Api` from `Lightning.Node.Api`.
3. Generate a servant client for this `Api`.
4. Use the client to talk to a node.

### Macaroon

```haskell
import qualified Authorization.Macaroon as Mac
```

And then use `Mac.load` to read your macaroon from a file.

### Generic client

A generic client will give you back a _record_ whose fields will contain
functions for accessing the API.

You will have to add these to your dependencies:

  - `servant`
  - `servant-client`
  - `servant-client-core`

Here is how to get a top-level generic client:

```haskell
import Servant.API.Generic (fromServant)
import Servant.Client (Client, ClientM)
import Servant.Client.Generic (AsClientT, genericClient)

import Lightning.Node.Api (Api (_v1), ApiV1 (..))

import qualified Lightning.Node.Api as L


api :: Api (AsClientT ClientM)
api = genericClient
```

Digging deeper to get actual endpoints is a little tricky (for example,
see [this issue](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/issues/1015)).
In order to unwrap the next level of the API, you will already need your
macaroon (see the previous section).

_TODO: Come up with a better way._

```haskell
_getInfo :: ClientM L.NodeInfo
_genInvoice :: L.InvoiceReq -> ClientM L.InvoiceRep
_listInvoices :: Maybe L.InvoiceLabel -> ClientM L.ListInvoicesRep
_pay :: L.PayReq -> ClientM L.PayRep

ApiV1
  { _getInfo
  , _genInvoice
  , _listInvoices
  , _pay
  } = fromServant @_ @(AsClientT ClientM) (_v1 api macaroon)
```

### Non-generic client

Alternatively, you can generate a plain non-generic servant client.

You will have to add these to your dependencies:

  - `servant`
  - `servant-client`

```haskell
import Data.Proxy (Proxy (Proxy))
import Servant.API ((:<|>) ((:<|>)))
import Servant.API.Generic (ToServantApi)
import Servant.Client (Client, ClientM, client)
import Lightning.Node.Api (Api)

import Authorization.Macaroon (Macaroon)
import qualified Lightning.Node.Api as L


api :: Client ClientM (ToServantApi Api)
api = client (Proxy :: Proxy (ToServantApi Api))

_getInfo :: ClientM L.NodeInfo
_genInvoice :: L.InvoiceReq -> ClientM L.InvoiceRep
_listInvoices :: Maybe L.InvoiceLabel -> ClientM L.ListInvoicesRep
_pay :: L.PayReq -> ClientM L.PayRep

_getInfo :<|> _genInvoice :<|> _pay = api macaroon
```
